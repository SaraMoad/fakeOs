### Features
- A Single Page Application

3 "Apps" that are consistent  within a flex menu positioned at the bottom of the screen. each selectable and will display content of a form, image or text. and can be closed. 

- Discord
- Email
- Notes.

The time will be in the far right corner. on a top nav.

The wallpaper scales to fit the viewport. 



## MVP:

### HTML/SCSS

-   Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport 
-   Minimum 3 icons on desktop
-   The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
-   Apps look consistent
-   Menu contains a flex with content inside it
-   Apps should be able to contain text, an image or a form

### JavaScript

-   Put your js code into separate files
-   Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
-   Give your functions and variables good names
-   Use the arrow syntax to declare functions

## Hints

-   Split your js logic/data modules from your js DOM modules
-   Look at the position css property, specifically _fixed_ and _absolute_
-   Pay attention to your hierarchy of elements in your html
-   Create your modals using JS and DOM interaction
-   Make your life easy! You don't need to recreate everything, just do the features and mvp mentioned above
